# Hello, world!

My name is Demi Marie Obenour, and I currently work for Invisible Things Lab.
I’m a software developer who primarily focuses on security, but my interests
aren’t limited to security or even software.  If it's related to Science,
Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM), I can understand it, and it has
practical applications, I'll probably enjoy discussing it.

I've found multiple security vulnerbilitities in a variety of products.
My forté seems to be finding incorrect bounds checks in C, but I've found other issues as well.
I hope to improve my security reviewing skills over time.

I designed a way to provide GPU acceleration to Xen guests and presented it at Xen Project Summit 2024.
This will ultimately be used to provide GPU acceleration to Qubes OS guests.

You can find my contributions in the Linux kernel, the Xen Project hypervisor,
Qubes OS, and other open-source tools.
